## Code Reviews

All contributions undergo a **thorough code review** to ensure they align with the vision and mission of the KNOXY License. Our review process is rigorous and designed to uphold:

## Security, Compliance, and Ethical Considerations

Your contributions must prioritize **security, compliance**, and **ethical responsibility**. The KNOXY License operates in a world where software is not only a technical tool but also a force for societal good. As such, contributions must:
- **Comply with all relevant laws**: From data privacy (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) to international trade regulations, your contributions should adhere to applicable laws in all jurisdictions.
- **Minimize security risks**: Ensure that your code does not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise user safety or software integrity.
- **Align with ethical standards**: Do not submit changes that could facilitate harmful behavior, such as creating malware, enabling surveillance, or enabling exploitation of vulnerable communities.

Failure to meet these standards may result in your contribution being rejected and your rights under the KNOXY License being revoked.
